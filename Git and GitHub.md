# 🧩 Git & GitHub Overview

---

## 🗂️ Git

### 📍 What is Git?
**Git** is a **version control system** used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It supports multiple versions, branching, and collaboration while keeping a complete history of changes.

### 💻 Real-World Example
A developer working on a **Python web app** wants to test a new feature. They create a branch, develop independently, and merge changes without disrupting the main project.

## 🌐 GitHub

### 📍 What is GitHub?
**GitHub** is a **cloud-based platform** that hosts Git repositories. It facilitates **team collaboration**, issue tracking, and code reviews, widely used in both open-source and enterprise projects.

### 💼 Real-World Example
A startup maintains a **Node.js application** on GitHub. Developers push updates daily, review code collaboratively, and manage feature branches efficiently.
