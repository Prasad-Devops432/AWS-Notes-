# 🌐 Public IP vs. Private IP (AWS Networking)

## 📡 Public IP

### 📍 What is it?
A **Public IP** is an **internet-routable IP address** that allows external systems to connect to your AWS resource.

### 🌐 Example
A web server with a public IP enables users to access a website (e.g., `www.example.com`).

### 🔁 Behavior
- Assigned dynamically by default when an instance launches.
- Can be made static using an **Elastic IP**.

## 🔒 Private IP

### 📍 What is it?
A **Private IP** is a **non-internet-routable IP address** used for internal communication within a VPC.

### 🧪 Example
A database server in a **private subnet** communicates with a web server using its private IP (e.g., `10.0.1.10`).

### 🔁 Behavior
- Fixed within the VPC unless manually changed.
- Not directly accessible from the public internet.

|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Scope            | Internet-routable                 | Internal VPC communication         |
| Visibility       | Accessible from public internet   | Hidden from public access          |
| Example Usage    | Web server                        | Backend database                   |
| Behavior         | Dynamic or Elastic                | Static within VPC                  |

## 💡 Real-World Analogy

Think of a company:
- Its **public-facing website** uses a **public IP**.
- Its **internal payroll system** runs on a **private IP** within a secure subnet.
