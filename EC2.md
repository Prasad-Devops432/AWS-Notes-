🚀 What is EC2 in AWS?
EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud.
It is a virtual server in the cloud that you can use to run websites, applications, or scripts.

🧠 Simple Analogy: "Renting a Computer"
Think of EC2 as renting a computer from AWS:

You don’t need to buy hardware.

You can choose the power (CPU, RAM, etc.).

You can start, stop, or delete it anytime.

You only pay for what you use.

💻 Real-World Example: Hosting a Website
Imagine you want to host a personal blog or portfolio website.

🧱 Without EC2:
You'd need to:

Buy a physical server

Connect it to the internet

Manage electricity, hardware failures, etc. ❌

✅ With EC2:
You can do all this in minutes:

Go to AWS EC2

Launch a new EC2 instance (e.g., Amazon Linux or Ubuntu)

Install a web server like Apache or Nginx

Deploy your website files

Your website is live and accessible on the internet!

🔧 EC2 Example Setup:
Component	Description
EC2 Instance	A virtual Linux/Windows server running in AWS
AMI (Amazon Machine Image)	Preconfigured OS template (e.g., Ubuntu)
Instance Type	Choose hardware (e.g., t2.micro = 1 CPU, 1 GB RAM)
Security Group	Acts like a firewall (e.g., allows HTTP & SSH)
Key Pair	Used to log in securely (SSH)

🧾 Real-Life Scenario:
Person	Role	What EC2 Does
You	Website owner	Use EC2 to host your website 24/7
Developer	Builds the app	Connects to EC2 via SSH, installs app/server
Visitors	Website users	Access the app via EC2 public IP or domain name
