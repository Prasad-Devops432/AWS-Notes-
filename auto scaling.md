# 🚀 AWS Auto Scaling

## ❓ What is Auto Scaling?
**Auto Scaling** automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on system demand or predefined conditions.

> 🏪 Example: Imagine your app as a pizza shop. During lunch rush, orders spike—Auto Scaling adds more delivery drivers (EC2 instances). When it’s quiet, it sends them home to save costs.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🔸 Auto Scaling Group
- Defines **minimum and maximum** number of EC2 instances
- Example: `min = 2`, `max = 10` servers

### 🔸 Scaling Policy
- Triggers scaling actions based on **CloudWatch metrics**
- Example: Scale out if **CPU utilization > 70%**

> 🛒 Example: During Black Friday, an e-commerce site auto-scales up to handle traffic, then scales down post-sale to reduce costs.
