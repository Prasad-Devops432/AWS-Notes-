# 🔒 SSH (Secure Shell)

## 📍 What is SSH?
**SSH (Secure Shell)** is a protocol that allows secure access to remote servers through an encrypted network connection.

---

## 💻 Real-World Example

A developer uses SSH to log into an EC2 instance to update a web application, similar to editing code remotely on a Linux server.

---

## 🧪 Usage Example

```bash
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
✅ Example:

bash
ssh -i prod-key.pem ec2-user@52.14.123.45
This command establishes a secure connection to a production EC2 Linux instance for tasks like maintenance, updates, or troubleshooting.

🧠 Key Concepts
Element	Description
🔑 .pem File	Private key for authentication (keep it secure!)
👤 ec2-user	Default username for Amazon Linux AMI
🌐 Public IP	The IP address of the EC2 instance
🔍 Best Practices
Keep your .pem key private — treat it like a password.

Use security groups to restrict SSH access to trusted IPs.

Disable SSH root login when unnecessary for added security.
